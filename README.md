Jave projects:
  -Private Messaging system:
    This project was completed originally without a GUI and later refactored with JavaFX.
    Uses TCP protocol to send text between 2 locally connected computers.

JavaScript projects:
  -Shorts Redirect Tool:
    This is a firefox web extention I made. I created this to solve a problem I had which is the Youtube Shorts webpage.
    I made this tool to automatically redirect me to the classic Youtube Webpage using javascript.

Python Projects:
  -Wikipedia Route finder:
    The Wikipedia game is a game where people race to get from a starting Wikipedia article to another article by only navigating the links on the page.
    This program attempts to navigate Wikipedia like a tree data strucure. A major problem is that this function grows exponentially with depth.
    In one of my tests with a max depth of 2, it navigated 262,798 pages.
    
  -Discord Music Bot:
    Uses Python and Discord API to play music in voice channels. This uses a few dependecies such as Youtube-dl, discord.py, PyNaCl, and FFMPEG. One of the major issues with this program is that youtube-dl is partly depricated.
    There is a current build of youtube-dl, but it has to be manually installed.

Visual Basic Projects:
  -Dungeon Arena:
    This is a simple game I made using Visual Basic. It features a randomly generated level each time the game is played. 
    The generation starts in the center and "walks" to another tile randomly, this tile becomes a walkable tile. This ensures that every tile on the map is accesible.
    The enemy pathing is exremely simple. It gets the minimum distance to the player and moves in that direction. It does not account for walls. 

Web Project
  -Ticket System:
    This project no longer works because the sql server is no longer online.
    This project is a simplified version of a ticketing system. Someone fills out a support ticket and is redirected to the waitlist page.
